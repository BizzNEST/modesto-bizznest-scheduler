## Development Pocess
To address the challenges of organizing randomized meetings, we developed a scheduling solution aimed at automating this process. Our goals include creating a user-friendly interface that is fully responsive for both mobile and desktop users. The front-end code prioritizes performance and ease of integration with backend systems, ensuring a seamless experience for developers. Additionally, we are committed to enhancing usability by providing clear, well-structured documentation that abstracts our features and methods, making it easy for all users to navigate and implement our software effectively.
